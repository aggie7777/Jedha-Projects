Instant Machine Learning Web Application with Streamlit and FastAPI

The goal of this project is to build complete end-to-end Regression ML model, Backend RestAPI to serve this model and front end UI so end user can interact and use it through web browser. Complete implementation is done Python language.

1. Build ML Model (In my case I did regression model)
2. Develop REST API as Backend ( I use FastAPI framework in python)
3. Develop Front End UI (I use Streamlit an open-source app framework as web applications)
